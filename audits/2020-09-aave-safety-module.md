## 1 Executive Summary

This report presents the results of our engagement with Aave to review the
Aave incentives smart contracts. The review was conducted over one week, from
September 7th to September 11th by Sergii Kravchenko and Bernhard Mueller. A
total of 10 person-days were spent.

## 2 Scope

Our review focused on the commit hash
[b125e181762a0318ce7dc1c9eed1b75d0520e343](https://gitlab.com/aave-tech/aave-stake/-/tree/b125e181762a0318ce7dc1c9eed1b75d0520e343). The list of files in
scope can be found in the Appendix.

The hash of the final commit with all fixes merged was
a058e0e4443b775f403ee49062e304e7d857e07e.

### 2.1 Objectives

Together with the Aave team, we identified the following priorities for our
review:

  1. Ensure that the system is implemented consistently with the intended functionality, and without unintended edge cases.
  2. Identify known vulnerabilities particular to smart contract systems, as outlined in our [Smart Contract Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/), and the [Smart Contract Weakness Classification Registry](https://swcregistry.io/).
  3. Identify ways of gaming or abusing the system, e.g. to drain funds from the rewards contract.

We specifically focused on identifying possible ways of gaming the staking,
rewards distribution and cooldown mechanisms, e.g.:

  * Ways of claiming rewards without any time passing between stake and unstake;
  * Incorrect updates of internal accounting (e.g. user can claim the same reward twice by transferring stakedTokens, etc.)l
  * Abusing or bypassing the cooldown.

## 3 Results Overview

We did not identify any critical issues that would have allowed to game the
system.

It was noted that the cooldown mechanism for unstaking can be manipulated to a
certain degree: A user could shorten the coolodown by splitting their stake
into chunks and starting the cooldown at different points in time. However,
while the mechanism isn't perfect, it still achieves its goal of preventing
users from unstaking if they anticipate being slashed. The effect of the
mechanism can be improved by choosing appropriate values for the cooldowbn and
unstaking window (see "issues" section).

Besides the above, only minor code quality issues and best practive violations
were found.

### 3.1 Recommendations

Review the issues and code quality recommendations documented in this report.

## 4 Issues

Each issue has an assigned severity:

  * Minor issues are subjective in nature. They are typically suggestions around best practices or readability. Code maintainers should use their own judgment as to whether to address such issues.
  * Medium issues are objective in nature but are not security vulnerabilities. These should be addressed unless there is a clear reason not to.
  * Major issues are security vulnerabilities that may not be directly exploitable or may require certain conditions in order to be exploited. All major issues should be addressed.
  * Critical issues are directly exploitable security vulnerabilities that need to be fixed.

### 4.1 Unhandled return values of transfer and transferFrom Medium ‚úì Fixed

#### Resolution

The issue was fixed by using OpenZeppelin's `safeTransfer` and
`safeTransferFrom` wrappers.

ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of
`transfer` and `transferFrom` could return 'false' on failure instead of
reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls into `require()` statements to these
failures.

**code/contracts/stake/StakedToken.sol:L92**

    
    
    IERC20(STAKED_TOKEN).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    

**code/contracts/stake/StakedToken.sol:L156**

    
    
    REWARD_TOKEN.transferFrom(REWARDS_VAULT, to, amountToWithdraw);
    

**code/contracts/stake/StakedToken.sol:L125**

    
    
    IERC20(STAKED_TOKEN).transfer(to, amount);
    

### 4.2 Staking cooldown can be avoided for a part of the funds Minor ‚úì Fixed

#### Resolution

The cooldown window will be set to much higher value (to the order of days) in
production. The mechanism is sufficient to prevent stakers from withdrawing if
the cooldown window is long enough while also being larger than the withdrawal
window.

Aave is planning to introduce a slashing mechanism for the staking system in
the future. In order to prevent stakers from withdrawing their stake
immediately, the team has added a "cooldown" mechanism. The idea is that
whenever stakers want to redeem the stake, they should call the `cooldown`
function and wait for `COOLDOWN_SECONDS`. After that, a time period called
`UNSTAKE_WINDOW` starts during which the stake can be withdrawn.

However, depending on the settings ("COOLDOWN_SECONDS" and "UNSTAKE_WINDOW"
values), various algorithms exist that would allow users to optimize their
withdrawal tactics. By using such tactics, stakers may be able to withdraw at
least a part of the stake immediately.

Let's assume that the values are the same as in tests: `COOLDOWN_SECONDS == 1
hour` and `UNSTAKE_WINDOW == 30 minutes`. Stakers can split their stake into 3
parts and call `cooldown` for one of them every 30 minutes. That would ensure
that at least 1/3 of the stake can be withdrawn immediately at any time. And
on average, more than 1/2 of the stake can be withdrawn immediately.

**Remediation:**

Make sure that the `COOLDOWN_SECONDS` value is much larger than the
`UNSTAKE_WINDOW`. This will make any cooldown optimization techniques less
effective.

### 4.3 Minor code quality issues Minor ‚úì Fixed

#### Resolution

all issues have been fixed in production.

We recommend the following improvements:

#### Fix todos

Clean up all TODOs before going into production:

**code/contracts/stake/AaveDistributionManager.sol:L44-L46**

    
    
    function configureAssets(DistributionTypes.AssetConfigInput[] calldata assetsConfigInput)
      external
    //    override TODO: create interface
    

#### Fix incorrect NatSpec comments

Clean up NatSpec comments to improve readability.

The function `claimRewards()` in `StakedToken` has the same description as the
`stake()` function:

**code/contracts/stake/StakedToken.sol:L141-L145**

    
    
     * @dev Stakes tokens to start earning rewards
     * @param to Address to stake for
     * @param amount Amount to stake
     **/
    function claimRewards(address to, uint256 amount) external override {
    

One function argument is missing from the docstrings for `claimRewards()` in
`AaveIncentivesController`:

**code/contracts/stake/AaveIncentivesController.sol:L97-L107**

    
    
    /**
     * @dev Claims reward for an user, on all the assets of the lending pool, accumulating the pending rewards
     * @param amount Amount of rewards to claim
     * @param to Address that will be receiving the rewards
     * @return Rewards claimed
     **/
    function claimRewards(
      uint256 amount,
      address to,
      bool stake
    ) external override returns (uint256) {

## Appendix 3 - Disclosure

ConsenSys Diligence ("CD") typically receives compensation from one or more
clients (the "Clients") for performing the analysis contained in these reports
(the "Reports"). The Reports may be distributed through other means, including
via ConsenSys publications and other distributions.

The Reports are not an endorsement or indictment of any particular project or
team, and the Reports do not guarantee the security of any particular project.
This Report does not consider, and should not be interpreted as considering or
having any bearing on, the potential economics of a token, token sale or any
other product, service or other asset. Cryptographic tokens are emergent
technologies and carry with them high levels of technical risk and
uncertainty. No Report provides any warranty or representation to any Third-Party in any respect, including regarding the bugfree nature of code, the
business model or proprietors of any such business model, and the legal
compliance of any such business. No third party should rely on the Reports in
any way, including for the purpose of making any decisions to buy or sell any
token, product, service or other asset. Specifically, for the avoidance of
doubt, this Report does not constitute investment advice, is not intended to
be relied upon as investment advice, is not an endorsement of this project or
team, and it is not a guarantee as to the absolute security of the project. CD
owes no duty to any Third-Party by virtue of publishing these Reports.

PURPOSE OF REPORTS The Reports and the analysis described therein are created
solely for Clients and published with their consent. The scope of our review
is limited to a review of Solidity code and only the Solidity code we note as
being within the scope of our review within this report. The Solidity language
itself remains under development and is subject to unknown risks and flaws.
The review does not extend to the compiler layer, or any other areas beyond
Solidity that could present security risks. Cryptographic tokens are emergent
technologies and carry with them high levels of technical risk and
uncertainty.

CD makes the Reports available to parties other than the Clients (i.e., "third
parties") - on its website. CD hopes that by making these analyses publicly
available, it can help the blockchain ecosystem develop technical best
practices in this rapidly evolving area of innovation.
