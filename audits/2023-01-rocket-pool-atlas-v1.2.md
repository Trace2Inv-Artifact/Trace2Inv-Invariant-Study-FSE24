## 1 Executive Summary

This report presents the results of our engagement with **Rocket Pool** to
review their upcoming Rocket Pool Atlas release (v1.2).

The review was conducted over three weeks, from **January 16, 2023** to
**February 03, 2023**. A total of 2x15 person-days were spent.

A critical reentrancy issue in the node distributor has been found, allowing a
node owner to drain funds from the respective distributor. Furthermore,
several major severity issues have been found regarding the updated Minipool
delegate contract and a node operator DAO contract.

### 1.1 Mitigations: 17 Mar 2023

Latest commit with changes: [rocket-pool/rocketpool@`77d7cca`](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/commit/77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6)

Compared to audit commit: [rocket-pool/rocketpool@7771afa‚Ä¶77d7cca](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/compare/7771afaff82e77a7525808056f2d60025fde3f8c..77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6)

The client provided code changes and remediation information for the findings
outlined in this report. Details and can be found in the Remediation Notes for
the respective findings in Section: Findings.

  * We removed one recommendation noting that zero initialization is unnecessary agreeing with and following the clients remark that "[‚Ä¶ ]Being explicit even if redundant is not a problem.".
  * We downgraded the finding "Missing extcodesize check in dynamic proxy" from `Major -> Medium` in agreement with the client as funds are not at immediate risk and they can recover from this problem. Nevertheless, this finding should be addressed as per the recommendation.
  * We downgraded the finding "Duplicate check to avoid revert" from `Minor -> Informational` given that it more a technical debt than a concrete security issue and the client provided a the following out-of-band fix: [rocket-pool/rocketpool@`3ab7af1`](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/commit/3ab7af12d4e1e4e82282fd4211ace74afaa1c6d3)

## 2 Scope

Our review focused on the following repositories:

  * [rocketpool@7771afa‚Ä¶fde3f8c](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/commit/7771afaff82e77a7525808056f2d60025fde3f8c)

Furthermore, the following information was provided:

  * [GitHub/Gist describing changes](https://gist.github.com/kanewallmann/cace4e37a19b14e1dc0335389503ee7d) (accessed January 2023)

### 2.1 Objectives

Together with the client, we identified the following priorities for our
review:

  1. Ensure that the system is implemented consistently with the intended functionality and without unintended edge cases.
  2. Identify known vulnerabilities particular to smart contract systems, as outlined in our [Smart Contract Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/), and the [Smart Contract Weakness Classification Registry](https://swcregistry.io/).
  3. Review key risks in regard to recent changes flagged by the development team:

>   * The minipool delegate has changed, and the possible state transitions
> are more complex.
>   * The deposit credit system used for the lower ETH bonded minipools and
> solo migration is new
>   * The minipool distribution (reward distribution) logic has changed
> considerably to incorporate partial withdrawals (skimming), optimizing
> withdrawals, and solo migration. With the Shanghai hard fork, this will be
> the first time these features will be exercised in production.

## 4 System Overview

This section describes the top-level/deployable contracts, their inheritance
structure and interfaces, actors, permissions and important contract
interactions of the system under review.

Contracts are depicted as boxes. Public reachable interface methods are
outlined as rows in the box. The üîç icon indicates that a method is declared as
non-state-changing (view/pure) while other methods may change state. A yellow
dashed row at the top of the contract shows inherited contracts. A green
dashed row at the top of the contract indicates that that contract is used in
a usingFor declaration. Modifiers used as ACL are connected as yellow bubbles
in front of methods.

## 5 Findings

Each issue has an assigned severity:

  * Minor issues are subjective in nature. They are typically suggestions around best practices or readability. Code maintainers should use their own judgment as to whether to address such issues.
  * Medium issues are objective in nature but are not security vulnerabilities. These should be addressed unless there is a clear reason not to.
  * Major issues are security vulnerabilities that may not be directly exploitable or may require certain conditions in order to be exploited. All major issues should be addressed.
  * Critical issues are directly exploitable security vulnerabilities that need to be fixed.

### 5.1 RocketNodeDistributorDelegate - Reentrancy in `distribute()` allows
node owner to drain distributor funds Critical ‚úì Fixed

#### Resolution

Fixed in <https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/tree/77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6> by implementing
a custom reentrancy guard via a new state variable `lock` that is appended to
the end of the storage layout. The reentrancy guard is functionally equivalent
to the OpenZeppelin implementation. The method was not refactored to give user
funds priority over the node share. Additionally, the client provided the
following statement:

> We acknowledge this as a critical issue and have solved with a reentrancy
> guard.

> We followed OpenZeppelin's design for a reentrancy guard. We were unable to
> use it directly as it is hardcoded to use storage slot 0 and because we
> already have deployment of this delegate in the wild already using storage
> slot 0 for another purpose, we had to append it to the end of the existing
> storage layout.

#### Description

The `distribute()` function distributes the contract's balance between the
node operator and the user. The node operator is returned their initial
collateral, including a fee. The rest is returned to the RETH token contract
as user collateral.

After determining the node owner's share, the contract transfers `ETH` to the
node withdrawal address, which can be the configured withdrawal address or the
node address. Both addresses may potentially be a malicious contract that
recursively calls back into the `distribute()` function to retrieve the node
share multiple times until all funds are drained from the contract. The
`distribute()` function is not protected against reentrancy:

**code/contracts/contract/node/RocketNodeDistributorDelegate.sol:L59-L73**

    
    
    /// @notice Distributes the balance of this contract to its owners
    function distribute() override external {
        // Calculate node share
        uint256 nodeShare = getNodeShare();
        // Transfer node share
        address withdrawalAddress = rocketStorage.getNodeWithdrawalAddress(nodeAddress);
        (bool success,) = withdrawalAddress.call{value : nodeShare}("");
        require(success);
        // Transfer user share
        uint256 userShare = address(this).balance;
        address rocketTokenRETH = rocketStorage.getAddress(rocketTokenRETHKey);
        payable(rocketTokenRETH).transfer(userShare);
        // Emit event
        emit FeesDistributed(nodeAddress, userShare, nodeShare, block.timestamp);
    }
    

We also noticed that any address could set a withdrawal address as there is no
check for the caller to be a registered node. In fact, the caller can be the
withdrawal address or node operator.

**code/contracts/contract/RocketStorage.sol:L118-L133**

    
    
    // Set a node's withdrawal address
    function setWithdrawalAddress(address _nodeAddress, address _newWithdrawalAddress, bool _confirm) external override {
        // Check new withdrawal address
        require(_newWithdrawalAddress != address(0x0), "Invalid withdrawal address");
        // Confirm the transaction is from the node's current withdrawal address
        address withdrawalAddress = getNodeWithdrawalAddress(_nodeAddress);
        require(withdrawalAddress == msg.sender, "Only a tx from a node's withdrawal address can update it");
        // Update immediately if confirmed
        if (_confirm) {
            updateWithdrawalAddress(_nodeAddress, _newWithdrawalAddress);
        }
        // Set pending withdrawal address if not confirmed
        else {
            pendingWithdrawalAddresses[_nodeAddress] = _newWithdrawalAddress;
        }
    }
    

#### Recommendation

Add a reentrancy guard to functions that interact with untrusted contracts.
Adhere to the checks-effects pattern and send user funds to the 'trusted' RETH
contract first. Only then send funds to the node's withdrawal address.

### 5.2 RocketMinipoolDelegateOld - Node operator may reenter `finalise()` to
manipulate accounting Major ‚úì Fixed

#### Resolution

The client acknowledges the finding and provided the following statement:

> We are aware of this issue (it was reported via our Immunefi bug bounty). It
> is live but that code path is inaccessible. It requires the oDAO to mark a
> minipool as Withdrawable which we don't do and have removed from the
> withdrawal process moving forward.

In a later revision, the development team fixed the issue in the following
commit: [73d5792a671db5d2f4dcbd35737e729f9e01aa11](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/commit/73d5792a671db5d2f4dcbd35737e729f9e01aa11)

#### Description

In the old Minipool delegate contract, a node operator may call the
`finalise()` function to finalize a Minipool. As part of this process, a call
to `_refund()` may be performed if there is a node refund balance to be
transferred. This will send an amount of `nodeRefundBalance` in ETH to the
`nodeWithdrawalAddress` via a low-level call, handing over control flow to an
- in terms of the system - untrusted external account that this node operator
controls. The node operator, therefore, is granted to opportunity to call back
into `finalise()`, which is not protected against reentrancy and violates the
checks-effects-interactions pattern (`finalised = true` is only set at the
very end), to manipulate the following system settings:

  * `node.minipools.finalised.count<NodeAddress>`: NodeAddress finalised count increased twice instead
  * `minipools.finalised.count`: global finalised count increased twice
  * `eth.matched.node.amount<NodeAddress>` \- NodeAddress eth matched amount potentially reduced too many times; has an impact on `getNodeETHCollateralisationRatio -> GetNodeShare`, `getNodeETHProvided -> getNodeEffectiveRPLStake` and `getNodeETHProvided->getNodeMaximumRPLStake->withdrawRPL` and is the limiting factor when withdrawing RPL to ensure the pools stay collateralized.

Note: `RocketMinipoolDelegateOld` is assumed to be the currently deployed
MiniPool implementation. Users may upgrade from this delegate to the new
version and can roll back at any time and re-upgrade, even within the same
transaction (see issue 5.3 ).

The following is an annotated call stack from a node operator calling
`minipool.finalise()` reentering `finalise()` once more on their Minipool:

    
    
    finalise() --> 
      status == MinipoolStatus.Withdrawable  //<-- true
      withdrawalBlock > 0  //<-- true
      _finalise() -->
         !finalised  //<-- true
            _refund()
                nodeRefundBalance = 0  //<-- reset refund balance
                  ---> extCall: nodeWithdrawalAddress
                         ---> reenter: finalise()
                            status == MinipoolStatus.Withdrawable  //<-- true
                            withdrawalBlock > 0  //<-- true
                            _finalise() -->
                                 !finalised  //<-- true
                                 nodeRefundBalance > 0  //<-- false; no refund()
                                 address(this).balance to RETH
                                 RocketTokenRETHInterface(rocketTokenRETH).depositExcessCollateral()
                                 rocketMinipoolManager.incrementNodeFinalisedMinipoolCount(nodeAddress)  //<-- 1st time
                                 eventually call rocketDAONodeTrusted.decrementMemberUnbondedValidatorCount(nodeAddress); 
                                 finalised = true;
                       <--- return from reentrant call
            <--- return from _refund()
         address(this).balance to RETH  //<-- NOP as balance was sent to RETH already
         RocketTokenRETHInterface(rocketTokenRETH).depositExcessCollateral();   //<-- does not revert
         rocketMinipoolManager.incrementNodeFinalisedMinipoolCount(nodeAddress);  //<-- no revert, increases
         'node.minipools.finalised.count', 'minipools.finalised.count', reduces 'eth.matched.node.amount' one to
         many times
         eventually call rocketDAONodeTrusted.decrementMemberUnbondedValidatorCount(nodeAddress);  //<-- manipulates
         'member.validator.unbonded.count' by +1
         finalised = true;  //<-- is already 'true', gracefully continues
    <--- returns     
    

**code/contracts/contract/old/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegateOld.sol:L182-L191**

    
    
    // Called by node operator to finalise the pool and unlock their RPL stake
    function finalise() external override onlyInitialised onlyMinipoolOwnerOrWithdrawalAddress(msg.sender) {
        // Can only call if withdrawable and can only be called once
        require(status == MinipoolStatus.Withdrawable, "Minipool must be withdrawable");
        // Node operator cannot finalise the pool unless distributeBalance has been called
        require(withdrawalBlock > 0, "Minipool balance must have been distributed at least once");
        // Finalise the pool
        _finalise();
    }
    

`_refund()` handing over control flow to `nodeWithdrawalAddress`

    function _finalise() private {
        // Get contracts
        RocketMinipoolManagerInterface rocketMinipoolManager = RocketMinipoolManagerInterface(getContractAddress("rocketMinipoolManager"));
        // Can only finalise the pool once
        require(!finalised, "Minipool has already been finalised");
        // If slash is required then perform it
        if (nodeSlashBalance > 0) {
            _slash();
        }
        // Refund node operator if required
        if (nodeRefundBalance > 0) {
            _refund();
        }
        // Send any left over ETH to rETH contract
        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            // Send user amount to rETH contract
            payable(rocketTokenRETH).transfer(address(this).balance);
        }
        // Trigger a deposit of excess collateral from rETH contract to deposit pool
        RocketTokenRETHInterface(rocketTokenRETH).depositExcessCollateral();
        // Unlock node operator's RPL
        rocketMinipoolManager.incrementNodeFinalisedMinipoolCount(nodeAddress);
        // Update unbonded validator count if minipool is unbonded
        if (depositType == MinipoolDeposit.Empty) {
            RocketDAONodeTrustedInterface rocketDAONodeTrusted = RocketDAONodeTrustedInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAONodeTrusted"));
            rocketDAONodeTrusted.decrementMemberUnbondedValidatorCount(nodeAddress);
        }
        // Set finalised flag
        finalised = true;
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/old/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegateOld.sol:L517-L528**

    
    
    function _refund() private {
        // Update refund balance
        uint256 refundAmount = nodeRefundBalance;
        nodeRefundBalance = 0;
        // Get node withdrawal address
        address nodeWithdrawalAddress = rocketStorage.getNodeWithdrawalAddress(nodeAddress);
        // Transfer refund amount
        (bool success,) = nodeWithdrawalAddress.call{value : refundAmount}("");
        require(success, "ETH refund amount was not successfully transferred to node operator");
        // Emit ether withdrawn event
        emit EtherWithdrawn(nodeWithdrawalAddress, refundAmount, block.timestamp);
    }
    

Methods adjusting system settings called twice:

**code/contracts/contract/old/minipool/RocketMinipoolManagerOld.sol:L265-L272**

    
    
    // Increments _nodeAddress' number of minipools that have been finalised
    function incrementNodeFinalisedMinipoolCount(address _nodeAddress) override external onlyLatestContract("rocketMinipoolManager", address(this)) onlyRegisteredMinipool(msg.sender) {
        // Update the node specific count
        addUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("node.minipools.finalised.count", _nodeAddress)), 1);
        // Update the total count
        addUint(keccak256(bytes("minipools.finalised.count")), 1);
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/dao/node/RocketDAONodeTrusted.sol:L139-L142**

    
    
    }
    function decrementMemberUnbondedValidatorCount(address _nodeAddress) override external onlyLatestContract("rocketDAONodeTrusted", address(this)) onlyRegisteredMinipool(msg.sender) {
        subUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(daoNameSpace, "member.validator.unbonded.count", _nodeAddress)), 1);
    }
    

#### Recommendation

We recommend setting the `finalised = true` flag immediately after checking
for it. Additionally, the function flow should adhere to the checks-effects-interactions pattern whenever possible. We recommend adding generic reentrancy
protection whenever the control flow is handed to an untrusted entity.

### 5.3 RocketMinipoolDelegate - Sandwiching of Minipool calls can have
unintended side effects Major

#### Resolution

The client provided the following statement:

> The slashed value is purely for NO informational purposes and not used in
> any logic in the contracts so this example is benign as you say. We have
> fixed this particular issue by moving the slashed boolean out of the
> delegate and into RocketMinipooLManager. It is now set on any call to
> rocketNodeStaking.slashRPL which covers both old delegate and new.

> We appreciate that the finding was more a classification of potential issues
> with upgrades and rollbacks. At this stage, we cannot change this
> functionality as it is already deployed in a non-upgradable way to over
> 12,000 contracts.

> As this is more of a guidance and there is no immediate threat, we don't
> believe this should be considered a 'major' finding.

With <https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/tree/77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6> the `slashed`
flag was moved to `RocketNodeStaking.slashRPL()`
(`minipool.rpl.slashed|<msg.sender> = true`).

The audit team acknowledges that this issue does not provide a concrete
exploit that puts funds at risk. However, due to the sensitive nature and
potential for issues regarding future updates, we stand by the initial
severity rating as it stands for security vulnerabilities that may not be
directly exploitable or require certain conditions to be exploited.

#### Description

The `RocketMinipoolBase` contract exposes the functions `delegateUpgrade` and
`delegateRollback`, allowing the minipool owner to switch between delegate
implementations. While giving the minipool owner a chance to roll back
potentially malfunctioning upgrades, the fact that upgrades and rollback are
instantaneous also gives them a chance to alternate between executing old and
new code (e.g. by utilizing callbacks) and sandwich user calls to the
minipool.

#### Examples

Assuming the latest minipool delegate implementation, any user can call
`RocketMinipoolDelegate.slash`, which slashes the node operator's RPL balance
if a slashing has been recorded on their validator. To mark the minipool as
having been slashed, the `slashed` contract variable is set to `true`. A
minipool owner can avoid this flag from being set By sandwiching the user
calls:

  1. Minipool owner rolls back to the old implementation from `RocketMinipoolDelegateOld.sol`
  2. User calls `slash` on the now old delegate implementation (where `slashed` is not set)
  3. Minipool owner upgrades to the latest delegate implementation again

In detail, the new slash implementation:

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L687-L696**

    
    
    function _slash() private {
        // Get contracts
        RocketNodeStakingInterface rocketNodeStaking = RocketNodeStakingInterface(getContractAddress("rocketNodeStaking"));
        // Slash required amount and reset storage value
        uint256 slashAmount = nodeSlashBalance;
        nodeSlashBalance = 0;
        rocketNodeStaking.slashRPL(nodeAddress, slashAmount);
        // Record slashing
        slashed = true;
    }
    

Compared to the old slash implementation:

**code/contracts/contract/old/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegateOld.sol:L531-L539**

    
    
    function _slash() private {
        // Get contracts
        RocketNodeStakingInterface rocketNodeStaking = RocketNodeStakingInterface(getContractAddress("rocketNodeStaking"));
        // Slash required amount and reset storage value
        uint256 slashAmount = nodeSlashBalance;
        nodeSlashBalance = 0;
        rocketNodeStaking.slashRPL(nodeAddress, slashAmount);
    }
    

While the bypass of `slashed` being set is a benign example, the effects of
this issue, in general, could result in a significant disruption of minipool
operations and potentially affect the system's funds. The impact highly
depends on the changes introduced by future minipool upgrades.

#### Recommendation

We recommend limiting upgrades and rollbacks to prevent minipool owners from
switching implementations with an immediate effect. A time lock can fulfill
this purpose when a minipool owner announces an upgrade to be done at a
specific block. A warning can precede user-made calls that an upgrade is
pending, and their interaction can have unintended side effects.

### 5.4 RocketDAONodeTrustedActions - No way to access ETH provided by non-member votes Major  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

According to the client, this is the intended behavior. The client provided
the following statement:

> This is by design.

#### Description

DAO members can challenge nodes to prove liveliness for free. Non-DAO members
must provide `members.challenge.cost = 1 eth` to start a challenge. However,
the provided challenge cost is locked within the contract instead of being
returned or recycled as system collateral.

#### Examples

    // In the event that the majority/all of members go offline permanently and no more proposals could be passed, a current member or a regular node can 'challenge' a DAO members node to respond
    // If it does not respond in the given window, it can be removed as a member. The one who removes the member after the challenge isn't met, must be another node other than the proposer to provide some oversight
    // This should only be used in an emergency situation to recover the DAO. Members that need removing when consensus is still viable, should be done via the 'kick' method.
    function actionChallengeMake(address _nodeAddress) override external onlyTrustedNode(_nodeAddress) onlyRegisteredNode(msg.sender) onlyLatestContract("rocketDAONodeTrustedActions", address(this)) payable {
        // Load contracts
        RocketDAONodeTrustedInterface rocketDAONode = RocketDAONodeTrustedInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAONodeTrusted"));
        RocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMembersInterface rocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMembers = RocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMembersInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMembers"));
        // Members can challenge other members for free, but for a regular bonded node to challenge a DAO member, requires non-refundable payment to prevent spamming
        if(rocketDAONode.getMemberIsValid(msg.sender) != true) require(msg.value == rocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMembers.getChallengeCost(), "Non DAO members must pay ETH to challenge a members node");
        // Can't challenge yourself duh
        require(msg.sender != _nodeAddress, "You cannot challenge yourself");
        // Is this member already being challenged?
    

#### Recommendation

We recommend locking the ETH inside the contract during the challenge process.
If a challenge is refuted, we recommend feeding the locked value back into the
system as protocol collateral. If the challenge succeeds and the node is
kicked, it is assumed that the challenger will be repaid the amount they had
to lock up to prove non-liveliness.

### 5.5 Multiple checks-effects violations Major

#### Resolution

The client provided the following statement:

> In many of the cited examples, the "external call" is a call to another
> network contract that has the same privileges as the caller. Preventing
> reentrancy against our own internal contracts provides no additional
> security. If a malicious contract is introduced via a malicious oDAO they
> already have full keys to the kingdom.

> None of the examples provide an attack surface and so we don't believe this
> to be a 'major' finding and should be downgraded.

This finding highlights our concerns about a dangerous pattern used throughout
the codebase that may eventually lead to exploitable scenarios if continued to
be followed, especially on codebases that do not employ protective measures
against reentrant calls. This report also flagged one such exploitable
instance, leading to a critical exploitable issue in one of the components.

This repeated occurrence led us to flag this as a major issue to highlight a
general error and attack surface present in several places.

From our experience, there are predominantly positive side-effects of adhering
to safe coding patterns, even for trusted contract interactions, as developers
indirectly follow or pick up the coding style from existing code, reducing the
likelihood of following a pattern that may be prone to be taken advantage of.

For example, to a developer, it might not always be directly evident that
control flow is passed to potentially untrusted components/addresses from the
code itself, especially when calling multiple 'trusted' components in the
system. Furthermore, individual components down the call stack may be updated
at later times, introducing an untrusted external call (i.e., because funds
are refunded) and exposing the initially calling contract to a reentrancy-type
issue. Therefore, we highly recommend adhering to a safe checks-effects
pattern even though the contracts mainly interact with other trusted
components and build secure code based on defense-in-depth principles to
contain potential damage in favor of assuming worst-case scenarios.

#### Description

Throughout the system, there are various violations of the checks-effects-interactions pattern where the contract state is updated after an external
call. Since large parts of the Rocket Pool system's smart contracts are not
guarded against reentrancy, the external call's recipient may reenter and
potentially perform malicious actions that can impact the overall accounting
and, thus, system funds.

#### Examples

`distributeToOwner()` sends the contract's balance to the node or the
withdrawal address **before** clearing the internal accounting:

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L564-L581**

    
    
    /// @notice Withdraw node balances from the minipool and close it. Only accepts calls from the owner
    function close() override external onlyMinipoolOwner(msg.sender) onlyInitialised {
        // Check current status
        require(status == MinipoolStatus.Dissolved, "The minipool can only be closed while dissolved");
        // Distribute funds to owner
        distributeToOwner();
        // Destroy minipool
        RocketMinipoolManagerInterface rocketMinipoolManager = RocketMinipoolManagerInterface(getContractAddress("rocketMinipoolManager"));
        require(rocketMinipoolManager.getMinipoolExists(address(this)), "Minipool already closed");
        rocketMinipoolManager.destroyMinipool();
        // Clear state
        nodeDepositBalance = 0;
        nodeRefundBalance = 0;
        userDepositBalance = 0;
        userDepositBalanceLegacy = 0;
        userDepositAssignedTime = 0;
    }
    

The withdrawal block should be set before any other contracts are called:

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L498-L499**

    
    
    // Save block to prevent multiple withdrawals within a few blocks
    withdrawalBlock = block.number;
    

The `slashed` state should be set before any external calls are made:

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L686-L696**

    
    
    /// @dev Slash node operator's RPL balance based on nodeSlashBalance
    function _slash() private {
        // Get contracts
        RocketNodeStakingInterface rocketNodeStaking = RocketNodeStakingInterface(getContractAddress("rocketNodeStaking"));
        // Slash required amount and reset storage value
        uint256 slashAmount = nodeSlashBalance;
        nodeSlashBalance = 0;
        rocketNodeStaking.slashRPL(nodeAddress, slashAmount);
        // Record slashing
        slashed = true;
    }
    

In the bond reducer, the accounting values should be cleared before any
external calls are made:

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolBondReducer.sol:L120-L134**

    
    
    // Get desired to amount
    uint256 newBondAmount = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.bond.reduction.value", msg.sender)));
    require(rocketNodeDeposit.isValidDepositAmount(newBondAmount), "Invalid bond amount");
    // Calculate difference
    uint256 existingBondAmount = minipool.getNodeDepositBalance();
    uint256 delta = existingBondAmount.sub(newBondAmount);
    // Get node address
    address nodeAddress = minipool.getNodeAddress();
    // Increase ETH matched or revert if exceeds limit based on current RPL stake
    rocketNodeDeposit.increaseEthMatched(nodeAddress, delta);
    // Increase node operator's deposit credit
    rocketNodeDeposit.increaseDepositCreditBalance(nodeAddress, delta);
    // Clean up state
    deleteUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.bond.reduction.time", msg.sender)));
    deleteUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.bond.reduction.value", msg.sender)));
    

The counter for reward snapshot execution should be incremented before RPL
gets minted:

**code/contracts/contract/rewards/RocketRewardsPool.sol:L210-L213**

    
    
    // Execute inflation if required
    rplContract.inflationMintTokens();
    // Increment the reward index and update the claim interval timestamp
    incrementRewardIndex();
    

#### Recommendation

We recommend following the checks-effects-interactions pattern and adjusting
any contract state variables before making external calls. With the
upgradeable nature of the system, we also recommend strictly adhering to this
practice when all external calls are being made to trusted network contracts.

### 5.6 Minipool state machine design and pseudo-states Medium  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

The client acknowledges the finding and provided the following statement.

> We agree that the state machine is complicated. This is a symptom of
> technical debt and backwards compatibility.

> There is no actionable response to this finding as we cannot make changes to
> the existing 12,000 contracts already deployed.

We want to emphasize that this finding strongly suggests that there are design
deficits in the minipool state machine that, sooner or later, may impact the
overall system's security. We suggest refactoring a clean design with clear
transitions and states for the current iteration removing technical debt from
future versions. This may mean that it may be warranted to release a new major
Rocketpool version as a standalone system with a clean migration path avoiding
potential problems otherwise introduced by dealing with the current technical
debt.

#### Description

The development team has provided the assessment team with a Minipool state
machine diagram. In this document, the `Destroyed` and `Finalised` states are
denoted as fully qualified Minipool states. However, these conditions are
pseudo-states. Specifically, the `Destroyed` pseudo-state leaves the Minipool
in the actual `Dissolved` state and removes it from the Minipool accounting
components. The `Finalised` pseudo-state sets the `finalised` flag on the
Minipool without changing its original state. Actors may still be able to
execute functions on the Minipool while it should be in an end state.

#### Recommendation

We strongly discourage the use of pseudo-states in state machines as they make
the state machine less intuitive and present challenges in mapping state
transitions to the code base. Real states and transitions should be used where
possible.

Generally, we recommend the following when designing state machines:

  * Using clear and descriptive transition names,
  * Avoiding having multiple transitions with the same trigger,
  * Modeling decisions in the form of state transitions rather than states themselves.

In any case, every Minipool should terminate in a clear end state.

### 5.7 RocketMinipoolDelegate - Redundant `refund()` call on forced
finalization Medium ‚úì Fixed

#### Resolution

Fixed in <https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/tree/77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6> by refactoring
`refund()` to avoid a double invocation of `_refund()` in the `_finalise()`
codepath.

> Fixed per the recommendation. Thanks.

#### Description

The `RocketMinipoolDelegate.refund` function will force finalization if a user
previously distributed the pool. However, `_finalise` already calls
`_refund()` if there is a node refund balance to transfer, making the
additional call to `_refund()` in `refund()` obsolete.

#### Examples

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L200-L209**

    
    
    function refund() override external onlyMinipoolOwnerOrWithdrawalAddress(msg.sender) onlyInitialised {
        // Check refund balance
        require(nodeRefundBalance > 0, "No amount of the node deposit is available for refund");
        // If this minipool was distributed by a user, force finalisation on the node operator
        if (!finalised && userDistributed) {
            _finalise();
        }
        // Refund node
        _refund();
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L445-L459**

    
    
    function _finalise() private {
        // Get contracts
        RocketMinipoolManagerInterface rocketMinipoolManager = RocketMinipoolManagerInterface(getContractAddress("rocketMinipoolManager"));
        // Can only finalise the pool once
        require(!finalised, "Minipool has already been finalised");
        // Set finalised flag
        finalised = true;
        // If slash is required then perform it
        if (nodeSlashBalance > 0) {
            _slash();
        }
        // Refund node operator if required
        if (nodeRefundBalance > 0) {
            _refund();
        }
    

#### Recommendation

We recommend refactoring the if condition to contain `_refund()` in the else
branch.

### 5.8 Sparse documentation and accounting complexity Medium  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

The client acknowledges the finding and provided the following statement:

> Acknowledged and agree.

#### Description

Throughout the project, inline documentation is either sparse or missing
altogether. Furthermore, few technical documents about the system's design
rationale are available. The recent releases' increased complexity makes it
significantly harder to trace the flow of funds through the system as
components change semantics, are split into separate contracts, etc.

It is essential that documentation not only outlines what is being done but
also _why_ and what a function's role in the system's "bigger picture" is.
Many comments in the code base fail to fulfill this requirement and are thus
redundant, e.g.

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L292-L293**

    
    
    // Sanity check that refund balance is zero
    require(nodeRefundBalance == 0, "Refund balance not zero");
    

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L333-L334**

    
    
    // Remove from vacant set
    rocketMinipoolManager.removeVacantMinipool();
    

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L381-L383**

    
    
    if (ownerCalling) {
        // Finalise the minipool if the owner is calling
        _finalise();
    

The increased complexity and lack of documentation can increase the likelihood
of developer error. Furthermore, the time spent maintaining the code and
introducing new developers to the code base will drastically increase. This
effect can be especially problematic in the system's accounting of funds as
the various stages of a Minipool imply different flows of funds and
interactions with external dependencies. Documentation should explain the
rationale behind specific hardcoded values, such as the magic `8 ether`
boundary for withdrawal detection. An example of a lack of documentation and
distribution across components is the calculation and influence of
`ethMatched` as it plays a role in:

  * the minipool bond reducer,
  * the node deposit contract,
  * the node manager, and
  * the node staking contract.

#### Recommendation

As the Rocketpool system grows in complexity, we highly recommend
significantly increasing the number of inline comments and general technical
documentation and exploring ways to centralize the system's accounting further
to provide a clear picture of which funds move where and at what point in
time. Where the flow of funds is obscured because multiple components or
multi-step processes are involved, we recommend adding extensive inline
documentation to give context.

### 5.9 RocketNodeDistributor - Missing `extcodesize` check in dynamic proxy
Medium  Won't Fix

#### Resolution

The client decided not to address the finding with the upcoming update. As per
their assessment, the scenario outlined would require a series of
misconfigurations/failures and hence is unlikely to happen. Following a
defense-in-depth approach we, nevertheless, urge to implement safeguards on
multiple layers as a condition like this can easily go undetected. However,
after reviewing the feedback provided by the client we share the assessment
that the finding should be downgraded from `Major` to `Medium` as funds are
not at immediate risk and they can recover from this problem by fixing the
delegate. For transparency, the client provided the following statement:

> Agree that an extcodesize check here would add safety against a future
> mistake. But it does require a failure at many points for it to actually
> lead to an issue. Beacuse this contract is not getting upgraded in Atlas, we
> will leave it as is. We will make note to add a safety check on it in a
> future update of this contract.

> We don't believe this consitutes a 'major' finding given that it requires a
> future significant failure. If such a failure were to happen, the impact is
> also minimal as any calls to distribute() would simply do nothing. A
> contract upgrade would fix the problem and no funds would be at risk.

#### Description

`RocketNodeDistributor` dynamically retrieves the currently set delegate from
the centralized `RocketStorage` contract. The target contract (delegate) is
resolved inside the fallback function. It may return `address(0)`.
`rocketStorage.getAddress()` does not enforce that the requested settings key
exists, which may lead to `RocketNodeDistributor` delegate-calling into
`address(0)`, which returns no error. This might stay undetected when calling
`RocketNodeDistributorDelegate.distribute()` as the method does not return a
value, which is consistent with calling a target address with no code.

#### Examples

**code/contracts/contract/node/RocketNodeDistributor.sol:L23-L31**

    
    
    fallback() external payable {
        address _target = rocketStorage.getAddress(distributorStorageKey);
        assembly {
            calldatacopy(0x0, 0x0, calldatasize())
            let result := delegatecall(gas(), _target, 0x0, calldatasize(), 0x0, 0)
            returndatacopy(0x0, 0x0, returndatasize())
            switch result case 0 {revert(0, returndatasize())} default {return (0, returndatasize())}
        }
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/RocketStorage.sol:L153-L155**

    
    
    function getAddress(bytes32 _key) override external view returns (address r) {
        return addressStorage[_key];
    }
    

#### Recommendation

Before delegate-calling into the target contract, check if it exists.

    
    
    assembly {
        codeSize := extcodesize(_target)
    }
    require(codeSize > 0);
    

### 5.10 Kicked oDAO members' votes taken into account Medium  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

The client acknowledges the finding and provided the following statement:

> We are aware of this limitation but the additional changes required to
> implement a fix outweigh the concern in our opinion.

#### Description

oDAO members can vote on proposals or submit external data to the system,
acting as an oracle. Data submission is based on a vote by itself, and
multiple oDAO members must submit the same data until a configurable threshold
(51% by default) is reached for the data to be confirmed.

When a member gets kicked or leaves the oDAO after voting, their vote is still
accounted for while the total number of oDAO members decreases.

A (group of) malicious oDAO actors may exploit this fact to artificially lower
the consensus threshold by voting for a proposal and then leaving the oDAO.
This will leave excess votes with the proposal while the total member count
decreases.

For example, let's assume there are 17 oDAO members. 9 members must vote for
the proposal for it to pass (52.9%). Let's assume 8 members voted for, and the
rest abstained and is against the proposal (47%, threshold not met). The
proposal is unlikely to pass unless two malicious oDAO members leave the DAO,
lowering the member count to 15 in an attempt to manipulate the vote, suddenly
inflating vote power from 8/17 (47%; rejected) to 8/15 (53.3%; passed).

The crux is that the votes of ex-oDAO members still count, while the quorum is
based on the current oDAO member number.

Here are some examples, however, this is a general pattern used for oDAO votes
in the system.

#### Example: RocketNetworkPrices

Members submit votes via `submitPrices()`. If the threshold is reached, the
proposal is executed. Quorum is based on the current oDAO member count, votes
of ex-oDAO members are still accounted for. If a proposal is a near miss,
malicious actors can force execute it by leaving the oDAO, lowering the
threshold, and then calling `executeUpdatePrices()` to execute it.

**code/contracts/contract/network/RocketNetworkPrices.sol:L75-L79**

    
    
    RocketDAONodeTrustedInterface rocketDAONodeTrusted = RocketDAONodeTrustedInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAONodeTrusted"));
    if (calcBase.mul(submissionCount).div(rocketDAONodeTrusted.getMemberCount()) >= rocketDAOProtocolSettingsNetwork.getNodeConsensusThreshold()) {
        // Update the price
        updatePrices(_block, _rplPrice);
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/network/RocketNetworkPrices.sol:L85-L86**

    
    
    function executeUpdatePrices(uint256 _block, uint256 _rplPrice) override external onlyLatestContract("rocketNetworkPrices", address(this)) {
        // Check settings
    

#### RocketMinipoolBondReducer

The `RocketMinipoolBondReducer` contract's `voteCancelReduction` function
takes old votes of previously kicked oDAO members into account. This results
in the vote being significantly higher and increases the potential for
malicious actors, even after their removal, to sway the vote. Note that a
canceled bond reduction cannot be undone.

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolBondReducer.sol:L94-L98**

    
    
    RocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipoolInterface rocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipool = RocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipoolInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipool"));
    uint256 quorum = rocketDAONode.getMemberCount().mul(rocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipool.getCancelBondReductionQuorum()).div(calcBase);
    bytes32 totalCancelVotesKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.bond.reduction.vote.count", _minipoolAddress));
    uint256 totalCancelVotes = getUint(totalCancelVotesKey).add(1);
    if (totalCancelVotes > quorum) {
    

#### RocketNetworkPenalties

**code/contracts/contract/network/RocketNetworkPenalties.sol:L47-L51**

    
    
    RocketDAONodeTrustedInterface rocketDAONodeTrusted = RocketDAONodeTrustedInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAONodeTrusted"));
    if (calcBase.mul(submissionCount).div(rocketDAONodeTrusted.getMemberCount()) >= rocketDAOProtocolSettingsNetwork.getNodePenaltyThreshold()) {
        setBool(executedKey, true);
        incrementMinipoolPenaltyCount(_minipoolAddress);
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/network/RocketNetworkPenalties.sol:L54-L58**

    
    
    // Executes incrementMinipoolPenaltyCount if consensus threshold is reached
    function executeUpdatePenalty(address _minipoolAddress, uint256 _block) override external onlyLatestContract("rocketNetworkPenalties", address(this)) {
        // Get contracts
        RocketDAOProtocolSettingsNetworkInterface rocketDAOProtocolSettingsNetwork = RocketDAOProtocolSettingsNetworkInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAOProtocolSettingsNetwork"));
        // Get submission keys
    

#### Recommendation

Track oDAO members' votes and remove them from the tally when the removal from
the oDAO is executed.

### 5.11 RocketDAOProtocolSettingsRewards - settings key collission Medium
Acknowledged

#### Resolution

The client acknowledges the finding and provided the following statement:

> We are aware of this limitation but making this change now with an existing
> deployment outweighs the concern in our opinion.

#### Description

A malicious user may craft a DAO protocol proposal to set a rewards claimer
for a specific contract, thus overwriting another contract's settings. This
issue arises due to lax requirements when choosing safe settings keys.

**code/contracts/contract/dao/protocol/settings/RocketDAOProtocolSettingsRewards.sol:L36-L49**

    
    
    function setSettingRewardsClaimer(string memory _contractName, uint256 _perc) override public onlyDAOProtocolProposal {
        // Get the total perc set, can't be more than 100
        uint256 percTotal = getRewardsClaimersPercTotal();
        // If this group already exists, it will update the perc
        uint256 percTotalUpdate = percTotal.add(_perc).sub(getRewardsClaimerPerc(_contractName));
        // Can't be more than a total claim amount of 100%
        require(percTotalUpdate <= 1 ether, "Claimers cannot total more than 100%");
        // Update the total
        setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(settingNameSpace,"rewards.claims", "group.totalPerc")), percTotalUpdate);
        // Update/Add the claimer amount
        setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(settingNameSpace, "rewards.claims", "group.amount", _contractName)), _perc);
        // Set the time it was updated at
        setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(settingNameSpace, "rewards.claims", "group.amount.updated.time", _contractName)), block.timestamp);
    }
    

The method updates the rewards claimer for a specific contract by writing to
the following two setting keys:

  * `settingNameSpace.rewards.claimsgroup.amount<_contractName>`
  * `settingNameSpace.rewards.claimsgroup.amount.updated.time<_contractName>`

Due to the way the settings hierarchy was chosen in this case, a malicious
proposal might define a `<_contractName> = .updated.time<targetContract>` that
overwrites the settings of a different contract with an invalid value.

Note that the issue of delimiter consistency is also discussed in issue 5.12.

The severity rating is based on the fact that this should be detectable by DAO
members. However, following a defense-in-depth approach means that such
collisions should be avoided wherever possible.

#### Recommendation

We recommend enforcing a unique prefix and delimiter when concatenating user-provided input to setting keys. In this specific case, the settings could be
renamed as follows:

  * `settingNameSpace.rewards.claimsgroup.amount.value<_contractName>`
  * `settingNameSpace.rewards.claimsgroup.amount.updated.time<_contractName>`

### 5.12 RocketDAOProtocolSettingsRewards - missing setting delimiters Medium
Acknowledged

#### Resolution

The client acknowledges the finding and provided the following statement:

> We are aware of this limitation but making this change now with an existing
> deployment outweighs the concern in our opinion.

#### Description

Settings in the Rocket Pool system are hierarchical, and namespaces are
prefixed using dot delimiters.

Calling `abi.encodePacked(<string>, <string>)` on strings performs a simple
concatenation. According to the settings' naming scheme, it is suggested that
the following example writes to a key named:
`<settingNameSpace>.rewards.claims.group.amount.<_contractName>`. However, due
to missing delimiters, the actual key written to is:
`<settingNameSpace>.rewards.claimsgroup.amount<_contractName>`.

Note that there is no delimiter between `claims|group` and
`amount|<_contractName>`.

**code/contracts/contract/dao/protocol/settings/RocketDAOProtocolSettingsRewards.sol:L36-L49**

    
    
    function setSettingRewardsClaimer(string memory _contractName, uint256 _perc) override public onlyDAOProtocolProposal {
        // Get the total perc set, can't be more than 100
        uint256 percTotal = getRewardsClaimersPercTotal();
        // If this group already exists, it will update the perc
        uint256 percTotalUpdate = percTotal.add(_perc).sub(getRewardsClaimerPerc(_contractName));
        // Can't be more than a total claim amount of 100%
        require(percTotalUpdate <= 1 ether, "Claimers cannot total more than 100%");
        // Update the total
        setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(settingNameSpace,"rewards.claims", "group.totalPerc")), percTotalUpdate);
        // Update/Add the claimer amount
        setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(settingNameSpace, "rewards.claims", "group.amount", _contractName)), _perc);
        // Set the time it was updated at
        setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(settingNameSpace, "rewards.claims", "group.amount.updated.time", _contractName)), block.timestamp);
    }
    

#### Recommendation

We recommend adding the missing intermediate delimiters. The system should
enforce delimiters after the last setting key before user input is
concatenated to reduce the risk of accidental namespace collisions.

### 5.13 Use of `address` instead of specific contract types Minor
Acknowledged

#### Resolution

The client acknowledges the finding, removed the unnecessary casts from
`canReduceBondAmount` and `voteCancelReduction` with

#### Description

Rather than using a low-level address type and then casting to the safer
contract type, it's better to use the best type available by default so the
compiler can eventually check for type safety and contract existence and only
downcast to less secure low-level types (`address`) when necessary.

#### Examples

`RocketStorageInterface _rocketStorage` should be declared in the arguments,
removing the need to cast the address explicitly.

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolBase.sol:L39-L47**

    
    
    /// @notice Sets up starting delegate contract and then delegates initialisation to it
    function initialise(address _rocketStorage, address _nodeAddress) external override notSelf {
        // Check input
        require(_nodeAddress != address(0), "Invalid node address");
        require(storageState == StorageState.Undefined, "Already initialised");
        // Set storage state to uninitialised
        storageState = StorageState.Uninitialised;
        // Set rocketStorage
        rocketStorage = RocketStorageInterface(_rocketStorage);
    

`RocketMinipoolInterface _minipoolAddress` should be declared in the
arguments, removing the need to cast the address explicitly. Downcast to low-level address if needed. The event can be redeclared with the contract type.

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolBondReducer.sol:L33-L34**

    
    
    function beginReduceBondAmount(address _minipoolAddress, uint256 _newBondAmount) override external onlyLatestContract("rocketMinipoolBondReducer", address(this)) {
        RocketMinipoolInterface minipool = RocketMinipoolInterface(_minipoolAddress);
    

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolBondReducer.sol:L69-L76**

    
    
    /// @notice Returns whether owner of given minipool can reduce bond amount given the waiting period constraint
    /// @param _minipoolAddress Address of the minipool
    function canReduceBondAmount(address _minipoolAddress) override public view returns (bool) {
        RocketMinipoolInterface minipool = RocketMinipoolInterface(_minipoolAddress);
        RocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipoolInterface rocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipool = RocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipoolInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipool"));
        uint256 reduceBondTime = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.bond.reduction.time", _minipoolAddress)));
        return rocketDAONodeTrustedSettingsMinipool.isWithinBondReductionWindow(block.timestamp.sub(reduceBondTime));
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolBondReducer.sol:L80-L84**

    
    
    function voteCancelReduction(address _minipoolAddress) override external onlyTrustedNode(msg.sender) onlyLatestContract("rocketMinipoolBondReducer", address(this)) {
        // Prevent calling if consensus has already been reached
        require(!getReduceBondCancelled(_minipoolAddress), "Already cancelled");
        // Get contracts
        RocketMinipoolInterface minipool = RocketMinipoolInterface(_minipoolAddress);
    

Note that `abi.encode*(contractType)` assumes `address` for contract types by
default. An explicit downcast is not required.

More examples of `address _minipool` declarations:

    /// @dev Internal logic to set a minipool's pubkey
    /// @param _pubkey The pubkey to set for the calling minipool
    function _setMinipoolPubkey(address _minipool, bytes calldata _pubkey) private {
        // Load contracts
        AddressSetStorageInterface addressSetStorage = AddressSetStorageInterface(getContractAddress("addressSetStorage"));
        // Initialize minipool & get properties
        RocketMinipoolInterface minipool = RocketMinipoolInterface(_minipool);
    

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolManager.sol:L474-L478**

    
    
    function getMinipoolDetails(address _minipoolAddress) override external view returns (MinipoolDetails memory) {
        // Get contracts
        RocketMinipoolInterface minipoolInterface = RocketMinipoolInterface(_minipoolAddress);
        RocketMinipoolBase minipool = RocketMinipoolBase(payable(_minipoolAddress));
        RocketNetworkPenaltiesInterface rocketNetworkPenalties = RocketNetworkPenaltiesInterface(getContractAddress("rocketNetworkPenalties"));
    

More examples of `RocketStorageInterface _rocketStorage` casts:

**code/contracts/contract/node/RocketNodeDistributor.sol:L8-L13**

    
    
    contract RocketNodeDistributor is RocketNodeDistributorStorageLayout {
        bytes32 immutable distributorStorageKey;
    
        constructor(address _nodeAddress, address _rocketStorage) {
            rocketStorage = RocketStorageInterface(_rocketStorage);
            nodeAddress = _nodeAddress;
    

#### Recommendation

We recommend using more specific types instead of `address` where possible.
Downcast if necessary. This goes for parameter types as well as state variable
types.

### 5.14 Redundant double casts Minor  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

The client acknowledges the finding and provided the following statement:

> Acknowledged. These contracts are non-upgradable.

#### Description

`_rocketStorageAddress ` is already of contract type `RocketStorageInterface`.

**code/contracts/contract/RocketBase.sol:L78-L82**

    
    
    /// @dev Set the main Rocket Storage address
    constructor(RocketStorageInterface _rocketStorageAddress) {
        // Update the contract address
        rocketStorage = RocketStorageInterface(_rocketStorageAddress);
    }
    

`_tokenAddress ` is already of contract type `ERC20Burnable`.

**code/contracts/contract/RocketVault.sol:L132-L138**

    
    
    function burnToken(ERC20Burnable _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount) override external onlyLatestNetworkContract {
        // Get contract key
        bytes32 contractKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(getContractName(msg.sender), _tokenAddress));
        // Update balances
        tokenBalances[contractKey] = tokenBalances[contractKey].sub(_amount);
        // Get the token ERC20 instance
        ERC20Burnable tokenContract = ERC20Burnable(_tokenAddress);
    

`_rocketTokenRPLFixedSupplyAddress` is already of contract type `IERC20`.

**code/contracts/contract/token/RocketTokenRPL.sol:L47-L51**

    
    
    constructor(RocketStorageInterface _rocketStorageAddress, IERC20 _rocketTokenRPLFixedSupplyAddress) RocketBase(_rocketStorageAddress) ERC20("Rocket Pool Protocol", "RPL") {
        // Version
        version = 1;
        // Set the mainnet RPL fixed supply token address
        rplFixedSupplyContract = IERC20(_rocketTokenRPLFixedSupplyAddress);
    

#### Recommendation

We recommend removing the unnecessary double casts and copies of local
variables.

### 5.15 RocketMinipoolDelegate - Missing event in `prepareVacancy` Minor ‚úì
Fixed

#### Resolution

Fixed in <https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/tree/77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6> by emitting a
new event `MinipoolVacancyPrepared`.

> Agreed. Added event per recommendation. Thanks.

#### Description

The function `prepareVacancy` updates multiple contract state variables and
should therefore emit an event.

#### Examples

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L286-L309**

    
    
    /// @dev Sets the bond value and vacancy flag on this minipool
    /// @param _bondAmount The bond amount selected by the node operator
    /// @param _currentBalance The current balance of the validator on the beaconchain (will be checked by oDAO and scrubbed if not correct)
    function prepareVacancy(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _currentBalance) override external onlyLatestContract("rocketMinipoolManager", msg.sender) onlyInitialised {
        // Check status
        require(status == MinipoolStatus.Initialised, "Must be in initialised status");
        // Sanity check that refund balance is zero
        require(nodeRefundBalance == 0, "Refund balance not zero");
        // Check balance
        RocketDAOProtocolSettingsMinipoolInterface rocketDAOProtocolSettingsMinipool = RocketDAOProtocolSettingsMinipoolInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAOProtocolSettingsMinipool"));
        uint256 launchAmount = rocketDAOProtocolSettingsMinipool.getLaunchBalance();
        require(_currentBalance >= launchAmount, "Balance is too low");
        // Store bond amount
        nodeDepositBalance = _bondAmount;
        // Calculate user amount from launch amount
        userDepositBalance = launchAmount.sub(nodeDepositBalance);
        // Flag as vacant
        vacant = true;
        preMigrationBalance = _currentBalance;
        // Refund the node whatever rewards they have accrued prior to becoming a RP validator
        nodeRefundBalance = _currentBalance.sub(launchAmount);
        // Set status to preLaunch
        setStatus(MinipoolStatus.Prelaunch);
    }
    

#### Recommendation

Emit the missing event.

### 5.16 Compiler error due to missing `RocketMinipoolBaseInterface` Minor ‚úì
Fixed

#### Resolution

Fixed in <https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/tree/77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6> by adding the
missing interface file.

#### Description

The interface `RocketMinipoolBaseInterface` is missing from the code
repository. Manually generating the interface and adding it to the repository
fixes the error.

### 5.17 Unused Imports Minor  Partially Addressed

#### Resolution

Addressed in <https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/tree/77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6> by removing all
but the following two mentioned unused imports:

  * `RocketRewardsPoolInterface`
  * `RocketSmoothingPoolInterface`

#### Description

The following source units are imported but not referenced in the importing
source unit:

The above list is exemplary, and there are likely more occurrences across the
code base.

#### Recommendation

We recommend checking all imports and removing unused/unreferenced and
unnecessary imports.

### 5.18 RocketMinipool - Inconsistent access control modifier declaration
`onlyMinipoolOwner` Minor  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

Acknowledged by the client. Not addressed within [rocket-pool/rocketpool@`77d7cca`](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/commit/77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6)

> Agreed. This would change a lot of contracts just for a minor improvement in
> readbility.

#### Description

The access control modifier `onlyMinipoolOwner` should be renamed to
`onlyMinipoolOwnerOrWithdrawalAddress` to be consistent with the actual check
permitting the owner or the withdrawal address to interact with the function.
This would also be consistent with other declarations in the codebase.

#### Example

The `onlyMinipoolOwner` modifier in `RocketMinipoolBase` is the same as
`onlyMinipoolOwnerOrWithdrawalAddress` in other modules.

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolBase.sol:L31-L37**

    
    
    /// @dev Only allow access from the owning node address
    modifier onlyMinipoolOwner() {
        // Only the node operator can upgrade
        address withdrawalAddress = rocketStorage.getNodeWithdrawalAddress(nodeAddress);
        require(msg.sender == nodeAddress || msg.sender == withdrawalAddress, "Only the node operator can access this method");
        _;
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/old/minipool/RocketMinipoolOld.sol:L21-L27**

    
    
    // Only allow access from the owning node address
    modifier onlyMinipoolOwner() {
        // Only the node operator can upgrade
        address withdrawalAddress = rocketStorage.getNodeWithdrawalAddress(nodeAddress);
        require(msg.sender == nodeAddress || msg.sender == withdrawalAddress, "Only the node operator can access this method");
        _;
    }
    

Other declarations:

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegate.sol:L97-L107**

    
    
    /// @dev Only allow access from the owning node address
    modifier onlyMinipoolOwner(address _nodeAddress) {
        require(_nodeAddress == nodeAddress, "Invalid minipool owner");
        _;
    }
    
    /// @dev Only allow access from the owning node address or their withdrawal address
    modifier onlyMinipoolOwnerOrWithdrawalAddress(address _nodeAddress) {
        require(_nodeAddress == nodeAddress || _nodeAddress == rocketStorage.getNodeWithdrawalAddress(nodeAddress), "Invalid minipool owner");
        _;
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/old/minipool/RocketMinipoolDelegateOld.sol:L82-L92**

    
    
    // Only allow access from the owning node address
    modifier onlyMinipoolOwner(address _nodeAddress) {
        require(_nodeAddress == nodeAddress, "Invalid minipool owner");
        _;
    }
    
    // Only allow access from the owning node address or their withdrawal address
    modifier onlyMinipoolOwnerOrWithdrawalAddress(address _nodeAddress) {
        require(_nodeAddress == nodeAddress || _nodeAddress == rocketStorage.getNodeWithdrawalAddress(nodeAddress), "Invalid minipool owner");
        _;
    }
    

#### Recommendation

We recommend renaming `RocketMinipoolBase.onlyMinipoolOwner` to
`RocketMinipoolBase.onlyMinipoolOwnerOrWithdrawalAddress`.

### 5.19 RocketDAO*Settings - `settingNameSpace` should be `immutable` Minor
Acknowledged

#### Resolution

Acknowledged by the client. Not addressed within [rocket-pool/rocketpool@`77d7cca`](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/commit/77d7cca65b7c0557cfda078a4fc45f9ac0cc6cc6)

> Acknowledged. We can fix this as we upgrade the related contracts.

#### Description

The `settingNameSpace` in the abstract contract `RocketDAONodeTrustedSettings`
is only set on contract deployment. Hence, the fields should be declared
immutable to make clear that the settings namespace cannot change after
construction.

#### Examples

  * `RocketDAONodeTrustedSettings`

**code/contracts/contract/dao/node/settings/RocketDAONodeTrustedSettings.sol:L13-L16**

    
    
    // The namespace for a particular group of settings
    bytes32 settingNameSpace;
    

**code/contracts/contract/dao/node/settings/RocketDAONodeTrustedSettings.sol:L25-L30**

    
    
    // Construct
    constructor(RocketStorageInterface _rocketStorageAddress, string memory _settingNameSpace) RocketBase(_rocketStorageAddress) {
        // Apply the setting namespace
        settingNameSpace = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("dao.trustednodes.setting.", _settingNameSpace));
    }
    

  * `RocketDAOProtocolSettings`

**code/contracts/contract/dao/protocol/settings/RocketDAOProtocolSettings.sol:L13-L14**

    
    
    // The namespace for a particular group of settings
    bytes32 settingNameSpace;
    

**code/contracts/contract/dao/protocol/settings/RocketDAOProtocolSettings.sol:L25-L29**

    
    
    // Construct
    constructor(RocketStorageInterface _rocketStorageAddress, string memory _settingNameSpace) RocketBase(_rocketStorageAddress) {
        // Apply the setting namespace
        settingNameSpace = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("dao.protocol.setting.", _settingNameSpace));
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/dao/protocol/settings/RocketDAOProtocolSettingsAuction.sol:L13-L15**

    
    
    constructor(RocketStorageInterface _rocketStorageAddress) RocketDAOProtocolSettings(_rocketStorageAddress, "auction") {
        // Set version
        version = 1;
    

#### Recommendation

We recommend using the `immutable` annotation in Solidity (see
[Immutable](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#immutable)).

### 5.20 Inefficiencies with the `onlyMinipoolOwner` modifier  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

Acknowledged by the client. No further actions.

> Correct. This change would change every single contract we have and so the
> benefit does not outweigh the change.

#### Description

If a withdrawal address has not been set (or has been zeroed out),
`rocketStorage.getNodeWithdrawalAddress(nodeAddress)` returns `nodeAddress`.
This outcome leads to the modifier checking the same address twice
(`msg.sender == nodeAddress || msg.sender == nodeAddress`):

**code/contracts/contract/minipool/RocketMinipoolBase.sol:L31-L37**

    
    
    /// @dev Only allow access from the owning node address
    modifier onlyMinipoolOwner() {
        // Only the node operator can upgrade
        address withdrawalAddress = rocketStorage.getNodeWithdrawalAddress(nodeAddress);
        require(msg.sender == nodeAddress || msg.sender == withdrawalAddress, "Only the node operator can access this method");
        _;
    }
    

**code/contracts/contract/RocketStorage.sol:L103-L111**

    
    
    // Get a node's withdrawal address
    function getNodeWithdrawalAddress(address _nodeAddress) public override view returns (address) {
        // If no withdrawal address has been set, return the nodes address
        address withdrawalAddress = withdrawalAddresses[_nodeAddress];
        if (withdrawalAddress == address(0)) {
            return _nodeAddress;
        }
        return withdrawalAddress;
    }
    

### 5.21 RocketNodeDeposit - Duplicate check to avoid revert ‚úì Fixed

#### Resolution

Fixed with [rocket-pool/rocketpool@`3ab7af1`](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/commit/3ab7af12d4e1e4e82282fd4211ace74afaa1c6d3) by
introducing a new method `maybeAssignDeposits()` that does not revert by
default but returns a boolean instead. This way, `RocketNodeDeposit` directly
call the `maybeAssignDeposits()` function, avoiding the duplicate check.

This finding does not present a security-related problem in the code base,
which is why we downgrade its severity to _informational_. However, we opted
to keep this recommendation present in the report since it underlines a form
of technical debt where old functionality is wrapped by new functionality
using a workaround.

#### Description

When receiving and subsequently assigning deposits, the `RocketNodeDeposit`
contract's `assignDeposits` function calls
`RocketDAOProtocolSettingsDeposit.getAssignDepositsEnabled` and skips the
assignment of funds. This is done because the
`RocketDepositPool.assignDeposits` function reverts if the setting is
disabled:

**code/contracts/contract/deposit/RocketDepositPool.sol:L207-L212**

    
    
    function assignDeposits() override external onlyThisLatestContract {
        // Load contracts
        RocketDAOProtocolSettingsDepositInterface rocketDAOProtocolSettingsDeposit = RocketDAOProtocolSettingsDepositInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDAOProtocolSettingsDeposit"));
        // Revert if assigning is disabled
        require(_assignDeposits(rocketDAOProtocolSettingsDeposit), "Deposit assignments are currently disabled");
    }
    

However, the underlying `_assignDeposits` function already performs a check
for the setting and returns prematurely to avoid assignment.

**code/contracts/contract/deposit/RocketDepositPool.sol:L217-L219**

    
    
    if (!_rocketDAOProtocolSettingsDeposit.getAssignDepositsEnabled()) {
        return false;
    }
    

The `rocketDAOProtocolSettingsDeposit.getAssignDepositsEnabled()` setting is
checked twice. The first occurrence is in `RocketNodeDeposit.assignDeposits`
and the second one in the same flow is contained in
`RocketDepositPool._assignDeposits`. The second check is performed in a
reverting fashion, thus requiring the top-level check in the
`RocketNodeDeposit` contract to preemptively fetch and check the setting
before continuing.

#### Recommendation

Since Rocketpool v1.2 already aims to perform an upgrade on the
`RocketDepositPool` contract, we do recommend adding a separate, non-reverting
version of the `RocketDepositPool.assignDeposits` function to the code base
and removing the redundant preemptive check in
`RocketNodeDeposit.assignDeposits`. This will improve readability and
maintainability of future versions of the code, and save gas cost on deposit
assignment operations.

### 5.22 Inconsistent Coding Style  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

The client provided the following statement:

> Acknolwedge your recommendation but we are dealing with an existing deployed
> codebase and if we change codestyle on only the contracts we update we will
> end up with a codebase with different code styles which is worse than one
> that is internally consistent but not consistent with best practice.

#### Description

Deviations from the [Solidity Style
Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html) were
identified throughout the codebase. Considering how much value a consistent
coding style adds to the project‚Äôs readability, enforcing a standard coding
style with the help of linter tools is recommended.

**Inconsistent Function naming scheme for external and internal interfaces**

Throughout the codebase, private/internal functions are generally prefixed
with an underscore (`_<name>`). This allows for an easy way to see if an
external party can interact with a function without having to scan the
declaration line for the corresponding visibility keywords. However, this
naming scheme is not enforced consistently. Many internal function names are
indistinguishable from external function names. It is therefore highly
recommended to implement a consistent naming scheme and prefix internal
functions with an underscore (`_<name>`).

## Appendix 2 - Disclosure

ConsenSys Diligence ("CD") typically receives compensation from one or more
clients (the "Clients") for performing the analysis contained in these reports
(the "Reports"). The Reports may be distributed through other means, including
via ConsenSys publications and other distributions.

The Reports are not an endorsement or indictment of any particular project or
team, and the Reports do not guarantee the security of any particular project.
This Report does not consider, and should not be interpreted as considering or
having any bearing on, the potential economics of a token, token sale or any
other product, service or other asset. Cryptographic tokens are emergent
technologies and carry with them high levels of technical risk and
uncertainty. No Report provides any warranty or representation to any Third-Party in any respect, including regarding the bugfree nature of code, the
business model or proprietors of any such business model, and the legal
compliance of any such business. No third party should rely on the Reports in
any way, including for the purpose of making any decisions to buy or sell any
token, product, service or other asset. Specifically, for the avoidance of
doubt, this Report does not constitute investment advice, is not intended to
be relied upon as investment advice, is not an endorsement of this project or
team, and it is not a guarantee as to the absolute security of the project. CD
owes no duty to any Third-Party by virtue of publishing these Reports.

PURPOSE OF REPORTS The Reports and the analysis described therein are created
solely for Clients and published with their consent. The scope of our review
is limited to a review of code and only the code we note as being within the
scope of our review within this report. Any Solidity code itself presents
unique and unquantifiable risks as the Solidity language itself remains under
development and is subject to unknown risks and flaws. The review does not
extend to the compiler layer, or any other areas beyond specified code that
could present security risks. Cryptographic tokens are emergent technologies
and carry with them high levels of technical risk and uncertainty. In some
instances, we may perform penetration testing or infrastructure assessments
depending on the scope of the particular engagement.

CD makes the Reports available to parties other than the Clients (i.e., "third
parties") - on its website. CD hopes that by making these analyses publicly
available, it can help the blockchain ecosystem develop technical best
practices in this rapidly evolving area of innovation.
