## 1 Executive Summary

This report presents the results of our engagement with **Flexa** to review
**Amp Token** and **Flexa Collateral Manager**. Flexa is a payment network,
using smart contract and Amp collateral to facilitate off-chain payments.

The review was conducted over the course of two weeks, from **June 9, 2020**
to **June 19, 2020** by Shayan Eskandari and Valentin Wüstholz. A total of
**15** person-days were spent.

The review of the initial report fixes were performed from August 10, 2020 to
August 14, 2020 by Shayan Eskandari.

## 2 Scope

Our review focused on the commit hash
**`4203e96d1138632a991d072d0c232fd8ba69c9e1`** for **`amp-contracts`** , and
**`4203e96d1138632a991d072d0c232fd8ba69c9e1`** for **`flexa-collateral-manager`**. The list of files in scope can be found in the Appendix.

**Update:** The final review of the initial report fixes were done on the
commit hash **`aece0f6b24df6348221da548a815528a6633a20e`** for [`amp-token-contracts`](https://github.com/amptoken/amp-token-contracts/commit/aece0f6b24df6348221da548a815528a6633a20e), and
**`8d421c295c2ed5d3eef12e5992d96efb8d10d2d3`** for [`flexa-collateral-manager`](https://github.com/flexahq/flexa-collateral-manager/commit/8d421c295c2ed5d3eef12e5992d96efb8d10d2d3).

### 2.1 Objectives

Together with the the **Flexa** team, we identified the following priorities
for our review:

  1. Ensure that the system is implemented consistently with the intended functionality, and without unintended edge cases.
  2. Identify known vulnerabilities particular to smart contract systems, as outlined in our [Smart Contract Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/), and the [Smart Contract Weakness Classification Registry](https://swcregistry.io/).

The second review was mainly a check for the fixes of the issues filed in the
initial report. The rest of the text in this report reflects the initial
review unless explicitly tagged as **Update**.

## 3 System Overview

The following figure is a visualization of the actors and the overview of
Flexa Collateral Manager with Amp Token:

[ ![Flexa Overview](files/Flexa_overview.png) ](files/Flexa_overview.png)

Many of the internal calls to view/pure functions and details regarding
partitions are removed from this chart for more readability.

The Actors and their permissions in the system are described in Security
specification section.

## 4 Security Specification

This section describes, **from a security perspective** , the expected
behavior of the system under audit. It is not a substitute for documentation.
The purpose of this section is to identify specific security properties that
were validated by the audit team.

### 4.1 Actors

The relevant actors are listed below with their respective abilities:

#### Flexa Collateral Manager

  * **owner**

    * Can _change ownership_
    * Can _set and change all other actors_ in the system at any time
    * Can _call all functionalities_ that other actors can call
    * Can _update the delay period_ (time-lock) in which fallback mechanism is activated (`fallbackWithdrawalDelaySeconds`)
  * **withdrawalPublisher**

    * _Can add Merkle Root for authorized token withdrawals_
      * Note that **the root is not verified** and can be an invalid value. Also the call to add root will remove the specified previous withdrawal roots in the smart contract.
    * _Can remove any of the previously added roots_ in the smart contract
  * **fallbackPublisher**

    * Can _set Fallback Merkle Root_ , which will update the fallback SetDate, MaxIncludedSupplyNonce and the root itself. 
      * Note that **the root is not verified** and can be an invalid value.
    * Can _reset fallback mechanism date_ , resulting in delay in fallback period without publishing new root, or to deactivate the fallback mechanism temporarily
  * **withdrawalLimitPublisher**

    * Can modify the global withdrawal limit 
      * Note: setting this limit to 0, disables all withdrawals and breaks the executions (e.g. `_executeWithdrawal`, `_executeConsumption`)
      * The value of `withdrawalLimit` also is decreased after every consumer execution
  * **consumer**

    * Can execute consumption (consumption transfers) 
      * Note that consumer is trusted, as in if consumer executes a transfer, he can spend up to `withdrawalLimit` which then all withdrawals will be impossible until _withdrawalLimitPublisher_ modifies the _withdrawalLimit_ to a number other than 0 to re-enable withdrawals.
  * **partitionManager**

    * Can add & remove new partitions to the system 
      * Removed partition will be disallowed from incoming transfers

All the above actors in this system are trusted in this system, meaning that
they could misbehave and temporarily block other functionalities of the
system, however they all can be replaced by `owner` as well.

**Update** : _consumer_ was renamed to _directTransferer_ to remove confusion.
All associated actions were also renamed, such as _consume_ ->
_directTransfer_ and so on.

#### Amp Token

  * **owner**

    * Can set partition strategy addresses, linking PartitionStrategy contracts to specific prefixes in the system
  * **operator**

    * Anyone can authorize an Operator for all their token balance or a specific partition.
    * Can transfer from user's balance (or the partition the operator is authorized for)
    * Any token holder is also his own operator

### 4.2 Important Security Properties & Trust Model

In any system, it's important to identify what trust is expected/required
between various actors. For this audit, we established the following trust
model:

  * Flexa (Actors in the system) are trusted, they can misbehave and update the contract in a way that the withdrawals are blocked.
  * The Merkle Tree Roots published on the smart contract can be removed/replaced by the publisher actor, making the valid withdrawals invalid. However the premise is that the publisher will act honestly and is part of the system.
  * There are some concerns about external call in Amp.Swap() regarding reentrancy or other malicious token implementations, however as swapToken here is previously deployed Flexa ERC20 token, we assume the token is trusted and does not have malicious intentions.
  * It should be noted that ERC777 introduces the hooks that have been used for reentrancy attack vectors in other DApps that have interacted with the ERC777 smart contract.
  * Partition Strategies are set by the Amp owner and we assume they are trusted, as there are external calls to the functions defined in these contracts.

## 5 Issues

Each issue has an assigned severity:

  * Minor issues are subjective in nature. They are typically suggestions around best practices or readability. Code maintainers should use their own judgment as to whether to address such issues.
  * Medium issues are objective in nature but are not security vulnerabilities. These should be addressed unless there is a clear reason not to.
  * Major issues are security vulnerabilities that may not be directly exploitable or may require certain conditions in order to be exploited. All major issues should be addressed.
  * Critical issues are directly exploitable security vulnerabilities that need to be fixed.

### 5.1 Eliminate assembly code by using ABI decode Major ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

All assembly code was replaced with proper use of `abi.decode()`.

#### Description

There are several locations where assembly code is used to access and decode
byte arrays (including uses inside loops). Even though assembly code was used
for gas optimization, it reduces the readability (and future updatability) of
the code.

#### Examples

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/partitions/PartitionsBase.sol:L39-L44**

    
    
    assembly {
        flag := mload(add(_data, 32))
    }
    if (flag == CHANGE_PARTITION_FLAG) {
        assembly {
            toPartition := mload(add(_data, 64))
    

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/partitions/PartitionsBase.sol:L43-L44**

    
    
    assembly {
        toPartition := mload(add(_data, 64))
    

Same code as above is also present here: `/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol#L1403` `flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol#L1407`

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L1463-L1470**

    
    
    for (uint256 i = 116; i <= _operatorData.length; i = i + 32) {
        bytes32 temp;
        assembly {
            temp := mload(add(_operatorData, i))
        }
        proof[index] = temp;
        index++;
    }
    

#### Recommendation

As discussed in the mid-audit meeting, it is a good solution to use ABI decode
since all uses of assembly simply access 32-byte chunks of data from user
input. This should eliminate all assembly code and make the code significantly
more clean. In addition, it might allow for more compact encoding in some
cases (for instance, by eliminating or reducing the size of the flags).

This suggestion can be also applied to Merkle Root verifications/calculation
code, which can reduce the for loops and complexity of these functions.

### 5.2 Ignored return value for transferFrom call Major ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

Fixed by adding a `require` to validate the success/failure of
`transferFrom()`.

#### Description

When burning swap tokens the return value of the `transferFrom` call is
ignored. Depending on the token's implementation this could allow an attacker
to mint an arbitrary amount of Amp tokens.

Note that the severity of this issue could have been Critical if [Flexa
token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4a57e687b9126435a9b19e4a802113e266adebde#code)
was any arbitrarily tokens. We quickly verified that Flexa token
implementation would revert if the amount exceeds the allowance, however it
might not be the case for other token implementations.

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L619-L620**

    
    
    swapToken.transferFrom(_from, swapTokenGraveyard, amount);
    

#### Recommendation

The code should be changed like this:

    
    
    require(swapToken.transferFrom(_from, swapTokenGraveyard, amount));
    

### 5.3 No integration tests for the two main components Medium ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

> `amp-contracts` added as a submodule to `collateral-manager` and full
> integration tests added

It is recommended to write test suites that achieve high code coverage to
prevent missing obvious bugs that tests could cover.

#### Description

The existing tests cover each of the two main components and each set of tests
mocks the other component. While this is good for unit testing some issues
might be missed without proper system/integration tests that cover all
components.

#### Recommendation

Consider adding system/integration tests for all components. As we've seen in
the recent issues in multi-contract smart contract systems, it's becoming more
crucial to have a full test suits for future changes to the code base. Not
having inter-component tests, could result in issues in the next development
and deployment cycles.

### 5.4 Potentially insufficient validation for operator transfers Medium ✓
Fixed

#### Resolution

removing `operatorTransferByPartition` and simplifying the interfaces to only
`tranferByPartition`

> This removes the existing tranferByPartition, converting
> operatorTransferByPartition to it. The reason for this is to make the client
> interface simpler, where there is one method to transfer by partition, and
> that method can be called by either a sender wanting to transfer from their
> own address, or an operator wanting to transfer from a different token
> holder address. We found that it was redundant to have multiple methods, and
> the client convenience wasn't worth the confusion.

#### Description

For operator transfers, the current validation does not require the sender to
be an operator (as long as the transferred value does not exceed the
allowance):

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L755-L759**

    
    
    require(
        _isOperatorForPartition(_partition, msg.sender, _from) ||
            (_value <= _allowedByPartition[_partition][_from][msg.sender]),
        EC_53_INSUFFICIENT_ALLOWANCE
    );
    

It is unclear if this is the intention or whether the logical `or` should be a
logical `and`.

#### Recommendation

Confirm that the code matches the intention. If so, consider documenting the
behavior (for instance, by changing the name of function
`operatorTransferByPartition`.

### 5.5 Potentially missing nonce check Medium  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

Nothing was done here, as Dave M writes:

> The first two are working as intended, and the third does check that the
> value is monotonically increasing.

#### Description

When executing withdrawals in the collateral manager the per-address
withdrawal nonce is simply updated without checking that the new nonce is one
greater than the previous one (see Examples). It seems like without such a
check it might be easy to make mistakes and causing issues with ordering of
withdrawals.

#### Examples

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L663-L664**

    
    
    addressToWithdrawalNonce[_partition][supplier] = withdrawalRootNonce;
    

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L845-L846**

    
    
    addressToWithdrawalNonce[_partition][supplier] = maxWithdrawalRootNonce;
    

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L1155-L1156**

    
    
    maxWithdrawalRootNonce = _nonce;
    

#### Recommendation

Consider adding more validation and sanity checks for nonces on per-address
withdrawals.

### 5.6 Unbounded loop when validating Merkle proofs Medium ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

The loop was removed by switching to `abi.decode`.

#### Description

It seems like the loop for validating Merkle proofs is unbounded. If possible
it would be good to have an upper bound to prevent DoS-like attacks. It seems
like the depth of the tree, and thus, the length of the proof could be
bounded.

This could also simplify the decoding and make it more robust. For instance,
in `_decodeWithdrawalOperatorData` it is unclear what happens if the data
length is not a multiple of 32. It seems like it might result in out-of-bound
reads.

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L1460-L1470**

    
    
    uint256 proofNb = (_operatorData.length - 84) / 32;
    bytes32[] memory proof = new bytes32[](proofNb);
    uint256 index = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 116; i <= _operatorData.length; i = i + 32) {
        bytes32 temp;
        assembly {
            temp := mload(add(_operatorData, i))
        }
        proof[index] = temp;
        index++;
    }
    

#### Recommendation

Consider enforcing a bound on the length of Merkle proofs.

Also note that if similar mitigation method as issue 5.1 is used, this method
can be replaced by a simpler function using ABI Decode, which does not have
any unbounded issues as the sizes of the hashes are fixed (or can be indicated
in the passed objects)

### 5.7 Mitigation for possible reentrancy in token transfers Medium ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

Fixed as recommended.

#### Description

ERC777 adds significant features to the token implementation, however there
are some known risks associated with this token, such as [possible reentrancy
attack vector](https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/uniswap-audit-b90335ac007). Given that the Amp token uses hooks to communicate to
Collateral manager, it seems that the environment is trusted and safe.
However, a minor modification to the implementation can result in safer
implementation of the token transfer.

#### Examples

In `Amp.sol --> _transferByPartition()`

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L1152-L1177**

    
    
    require(
        _balanceOfByPartition[_from][_fromPartition] >= _value,
        EC_52_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE
    );
    
    bytes32 toPartition = _fromPartition;
    if (_data.length >= 64) {
        toPartition = _getDestinationPartition(_fromPartition, _data);
    }
    
    _callPreTransferHooks(
        _fromPartition,
        _operator,
        _from,
        _to,
        _value,
        _data,
        _operatorData
    );
    
    _removeTokenFromPartition(_from, _fromPartition, _value);
    _transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    _addTokenToPartition(_to, toPartition, _value);
    
    _callPostTransferHooks(
        toPartition,
    

#### Recommendation

It is suggested to move any condition check that is checking the balance to
after the external call. However `_callPostTransferHooks` needs to be called
after the state changes, so the suggested mitigation here is to move the
require at line 1152 to after `_callPreTransferHooks()` function (e.g. line
1171).

### 5.8 Potentially inconsistent input validation Medium ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

`transferWithData` was removed as a resolution of another filed issue, the
rest are documented properly.

> The `msg.sender` cannot be authorized or revoked from being an operator for
> itself. This should also be clear from the natspec comments now.

#### Description

There are some functions that might require additional input validation
(similar to other functions):

#### Examples

  * `Amp.transferWithData`: `require(_isOperator(msg.sender, _from), EC_58_INVALID_OPERATOR);` like in

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L699**

    
    
    require(_isOperator(msg.sender, _from), EC_58_INVALID_OPERATOR);
    

  * `Amp.authorizeOperatorByPartition`: `require(_operator != msg.sender);` like in

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L789**

    
    
    require(_operator != msg.sender);
    

  * `Amp.revokeOperatorByPartition`: `require(_operator != msg.sender);` like in

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L800**

    
    
    require(_operator != msg.sender);
    

#### Recommendation

Consider adding additional input validation.

### 5.9 ERC20 compatibility of Amp token using defaultPartition Medium ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

This fix resulted in significant changes to the token allowance work flow. The
new implementation of `balanceOf` represents the total balance of tokens at
that address (across any partition), instead of only default partition.

> The approve + allowance based operations were using a distinct global
> allowance mapping, while the rest of the ERC20 compat operations were using
> the partition state mappings with the default partition. This makes the
> allowance operations behave the same as the balance based operations.

#### Description

It is somewhat unclear how the Amp token ensures ERC20 compatibility. While
the `default` partition is used in some places (for instance, in function
`balanceOf`) there are also separate fields for (aggregated)
balances/allowances. This seems to introduce some redundancy and raises
certain questions about when which fields are relevant.

#### Examples

  * `_allowed` is used in function `allowance` instead of `_allowedByPartition` with the default partition

  * An `Approval` event should be emitted when approving the default partition

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L1494**

    
    
    emit ApprovalByPartition(_partition, _tokenHolder, _spender, _amount);
    

  * `increaseAllowance()` vs. `increaseAllowanceByPartition()`

#### Recommendation

After the mid-audit discussion, it was clear that the general `balanceOf`
method (with no partition) is not needed and can be replaced with a
`balanceOf` function that returns balance of the default partition, similarly
for allowance, the general `increaseAllowance` function can simply call
`increaseAllowanceByPartition` using default partition (same for
decreaseAllowance).

### 5.10 Duplicate code better be moved to shared library Minor ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

aforementioned functions were moved to a shared library `PartitionUtils.sol`,
which also fixed the inconsistency in function implementations.

#### Description

There are some functionalities that the code is duplicated between different
smart contracts.

#### Examples

  * `_getDestinationPartition()` is present in both `PartitionBase.sol` and `FlexaCollateralManager.sol`
    * Note that in `PartitionBase` the usage results in dead code in the contract.

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L1158-L1160**

    
    
    if (_data.length >= 64) {
        toPartition = _getDestinationPartition(_fromPartition, _data);
    }
    

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/partitions/PartitionsBase.sol:L33-L36**

    
    
    toPartition = _fromPartition;
    if (_data.length < 64) {
        return toPartition;
    }
    

  * `_splitPartition()` is present in `FlexaCollateralManager.sol`, `PartitionBase.sol` with slightly different implementations. One has an extra return value for `subPartition` which is not used in the code under audit

#### Recommendation

Use a shared library for these functions, possibly `ParitionBased.sol` can be
used in Collateral Manager.

### 5.11 Additional validation for canReceive Minor ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

Added proper checks and merged `_canReceive()` with `canReceive()`.

#### Description

For `FlexaCollateralManager.tokensReceived` there is validation to ensure that
only the Amp calls the function. In contrast, there is no such validation for
`canReceive` and it is unclear if this is the intention.

#### Examples

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L492-L493**

    
    
    require(msg.sender == amp, "Invalid sender");
    

#### Recommendation

Consider adding a conjunct `msg.sender == amp` in function `_canReceive`.

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L468-L470**

    
    
    function _canReceive(address _to, bytes32 _destinationPartition) internal view returns (bool) {
        return _to == address(this) && partitions[_destinationPartition];
    }
    

### 5.12 Update to Solidity 0.6.10 Minor ✓ Fixed

#### Resolution

Updated to `0.6.10`.

#### Description

Due to an [issue
found](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/06/11/solidity-0610-release-announcement/) in 0.6.9, it is recommended to update the compiler version to
latest version 0.6.10.

### 5.13 Discrepancy between code and comments Minor ✓ Fixed

#### Description

There are some discrepancies between (uncommented) code and the documentations
comment:

#### Examples

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L459-L462**

    
    
    // Indicate token verifies Amp, ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces
    ERC1820Implementer._setInterface(AMP_INTERFACE_NAME);
    ERC1820Implementer._setInterface(ERC20_INTERFACE_NAME);
    // ERC1820Implementer._setInterface(ERC777_INTERFACE_NAME);
    

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L268-L279**

    
    
    /**
     * @notice Indicates a supply refund was executed
     * @param supplier Address whose refund authorization was executed
     * @param partition Partition from which the tokens were transferred
     * @param amount Amount of tokens transferred
     */
    event SupplyRefund(
        address indexed supplier,
        bytes32 indexed partition,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 indexed nonce
    );
    

#### Recommendation

Consider updating either the code or the comment.

### 5.14 Several fields could potentially be private Minor  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

: Comment from Flexa team:

> We audited the suggested fields, and determined that we would like them to
> be public for transparency and/or functionality reasons.

#### Description

Several fields in `Amp` could possibly be private:

#### Examples

  * `swapToken`:

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L261**

    
    
    ISwapToken public swapToken;
    

  * `swapTokenGraveyard`:

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L268**

    
    
    address public constant swapTokenGraveyard = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD;
    

  * `collateralManagers`:

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L236**

    
    
    address[] public collateralManagers;
    

  * `partitionStrategies`:

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L248**

    
    
    bytes4[] public partitionStrategies;
    

The same hold for several fields in `FlexaCollateralManager`. For instance:

  * `partitions`:

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L78**

    
    
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public partitions;
    

  * `nonceToSupply`:

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L144**

    
    
    mapping(uint256 => Supply) public nonceToSupply;
    

  * `withdrawalRootToNonce`:

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L163**

    
    
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public withdrawalRootToNonce;
    

#### Recommendation

Double-check that you really want to expose those fields.

### 5.15 Several fields could be declared immutable Minor  Acknowledged

#### Resolution

Comment from Flexa team:

> We tried to add this, but found that it made validating the contract on
> Etherscan impossible. We have added comments to a reader of the contract
> indicating the fields are immutable after deployment, though.

#### Description

Several fields could be declared immutable to make clear that they never
change after construction:

#### Examples

  * `Amp._name`:

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L129**

    
    
    string internal _name;
    

  * `Amp._symbol`:

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L134**

    
    
    string internal _symbol;
    

  * `Amp.swapToken`:

**code/amp-contracts/contracts/Amp.sol:L261**

    
    
    ISwapToken public swapToken;
    

  * `FlexaCollateralManager.amp`:

**code/flexa-collateral-manager/contracts/FlexaCollateralManager.sol:L73**

    
    
    address public amp;
    

#### Recommendation

Use the `immutable` annotation in Solidity (see
[Immutable](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#immutable)).

## Appendix 1 - Artifacts

This section contains some of the artifacts generated during our review by
automated tools, the test suite, etc. If any issues or recommendations were
identified by the output presented here, they have been addressed in the
appropriate section above.

### A.1.1 Harvey

As part of the audit, we performed several fuzzing campaigns using Harvey, our
in-house [greybox fuzzer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06944.pdf) for smart
contracts, to check 8 custom properties. In order to fuzz the entire contract
system, we used Flexa's existing deployment scripts to set up an initial state
for the fuzzer containing the following contracts:

  * Amp
  * FlexaCollateralManager
  * ERC1820Registry
  * MockFXC
  * HolderCollateralPartitionValidator
  * CollateralPoolPartitionValidator

We extended the deployment scripts to distribute MockFXC tokens to several
known users such that they could interact with the system after approving the
Amp contract. We also made a small number of changes to the code to improve
the effectiveness of the fuzzer. Our final 24-hour fuzzing campaign was able
to detect 3 property violations that were reviewed as part of the audit.

Note that--to support the auditor--several properties check if certain (not
necessarily bad/dangerous) states are feasible and violations do not
necessarily indicate issues with the code.

The graphs below provide an indication of the instruction and basic block
transition coverage achieved by Harvey over time. After 24 hours, Harvey
achieved the following coverage:

  * EVM instruction coverage: 28090
  * Path coverage: 7747
  * EVM basic block transition coverage: 1904

It's important to note that "100% test coverage" is not a silver bullet. Our
review also included a inspection of the test suite to ensure that testing
included important edge cases.

## Appendix 3 - Disclosure

ConsenSys Diligence ("CD") typically receives compensation from one or more
clients (the "Clients") for performing the analysis contained in these reports
(the "Reports"). The Reports may be distributed through other means, including
via ConsenSys publications and other distributions.

The Reports are not an endorsement or indictment of any particular project or
team, and the Reports do not guarantee the security of any particular project.
This Report does not consider, and should not be interpreted as considering or
having any bearing on, the potential economics of a token, token sale or any
other product, service or other asset. Cryptographic tokens are emergent
technologies and carry with them high levels of technical risk and
uncertainty. No Report provides any warranty or representation to any Third-Party in any respect, including regarding the bugfree nature of code, the
business model or proprietors of any such business model, and the legal
compliance of any such business. No third party should rely on the Reports in
any way, including for the purpose of making any decisions to buy or sell any
token, product, service or other asset. Specifically, for the avoidance of
doubt, this Report does not constitute investment advice, is not intended to
be relied upon as investment advice, is not an endorsement of this project or
team, and it is not a guarantee as to the absolute security of the project. CD
owes no duty to any Third-Party by virtue of publishing these Reports.

PURPOSE OF REPORTS The Reports and the analysis described therein are created
solely for Clients and published with their consent. The scope of our review
is limited to a review of Solidity code and only the Solidity code we note as
being within the scope of our review within this report. The Solidity language
itself remains under development and is subject to unknown risks and flaws.
The review does not extend to the compiler layer, or any other areas beyond
Solidity that could present security risks. Cryptographic tokens are emergent
technologies and carry with them high levels of technical risk and
uncertainty.

CD makes the Reports available to parties other than the Clients (i.e., "third
parties") - on its website. CD hopes that by making these analyses publicly
available, it can help the blockchain ecosystem develop technical best
practices in this rapidly evolving area of innovation.
