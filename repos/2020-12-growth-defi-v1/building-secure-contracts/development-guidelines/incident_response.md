# Incident Response Guidelines

How you respond during an incident is a direct reflection of your efforts to prepare for such an event. Adherance to our guidelines can help you shift from a reactive approach to a **proactive** approach by planning with the assumption that incidents are inevitable. To fully leverage the following guidelines, consider them throughout the application development process.

## Application design

- **Identify the components that should/should not be**
  - **Pausable**. While pausing a component can be beneficial during an incident, you must assess its potential impact on other contracts.
  - **Migratable or upgradeable**. Discovering a bug might necessitate a [migration strategy](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/10/29/how-contract-migration-works/) or contract upgrade to fix the issue; note, however, that upgradeability has its own [sets of risks](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2020/12/16/breaking-aave-upgradeability/). Making all contracts upgradeable might not be the best approach.
  - **Decentralized**. Using decentralized components can sometimes restrict rescue measures.
- **Evaluate what events are needed**. A missed event in a critical location might result in unnoticed incidents.
- **Evaluate what components must be on-chain and off-chain**. On-chain components are generally more at risk, but off-chain components push the risks to the off-chain owner.
- **Use an access control that allows fine-grained access**. Avoid setting all access controls to be available to an EOA. Opt for multisig wallets/MPC, and segregate access (e.g., the key responsible for setting fees shouldn't have access to the upgradeability feature).

## Documentation

- **Document how to interpret abnormal events emission**. Only emitting events isn't sufficient; proper documentation is crucial, and users should be empowered to decode them.
- **Document how to access wallets**. Clearly outline how to access wallets. Both the location and access procedures for every wallet should be clear and straightforward.
- **Document the deployment and upgrade process**. Deployment and upgrade processes are risky and must be thoroughly documented. This should include how to test the deployment/upgrade (ex: using fork testing) and how to validate it (ex: using a post-deployment script).
- **Document how to contact the users and external dependencies**. Define guidelines regarding which stakeholders to contact, including the timing and mode of communication in case of incidents.

## Process

- **Conduct periodic training and incident response exercises**. Regularly organize training sessions and incident response exercises. Such measures ensure that employees remain updated and can help highlight any flaws in the current incident response protocol.
- **Identify incident owners, with at least**:
  - **A technical lead**. Responsible for gathering and centralizing technical data.
  - **A communication lead**. Tasked with internal and external communication.
  - **A legal lead**. Either provides legal advice or ensures the right legal entities are contacted. It might also be worth considering liaison with appropriate law enforcement agencies.
- **Use automated monitoring tools**. Whether you opt for an in-house solution or third-party products, automation is key. While considering automated responses like pausing the system in the event of irregular activities, exercise caution. Without careful configuration, automatic responses might inadvertently facilitate denial-of-service (DOS) exploits.

## Threat Intelligence

- **Identify similar protocols, and stay informed of related compromises**. Being aware of vulnerabilities in similar systems can help preemptively address potential threats in your own.
- **Identify dependencies, and monitor their behaviors to be alerted in case of compromise.** Follow twitter, discord, newsletter, etc.
- **Maintain open communication lines with your dependencies owners**. This will help you to stay informed if one of your dependency is compromised.
- **Subscribe to https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/**. BlockThreat will help you stay informed about recent incidents.

Additionally, consider conducting a threat modeling exercise. This exercise will identify risks that an application faces at both the structural and operational level.
