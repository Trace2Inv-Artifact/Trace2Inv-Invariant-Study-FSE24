## 1. <a name='Overview'></a>Overview

DKG (Distributed Key Generation) is a method to generate secret keys across several parties.

In SKALE protocol we use DKG to distribute BLS keys across nodes which are connected to one SKALE-chain. Connected nodes should send generated data (by off-chain source) to SkaleDKG smart contract. Also each node should get data from every other node by reading events with data. If a node forgets to send data or additional required transactions, other nodes have responsibility to send a transaction to SkaleDKG smart contract and inform about malicious node(s).

## 4. <a name='DKGprocedure'></a>DKG procedure

Goal: Each node should have its own BLS private key and BLS master public key should be stored in KeyStorage

Precondition:

All parts register their public keys before (during node registration)

Group of 16 nodes created

### 4.1. <a name='Definitions:'></a>Definitions

Channel - public channel to share all information(private and public). All parties send transactions with a unique identifier for the channel and all parties catch(Events) or get information by the unique identifier for the channel.

Broadcast by node - node A generates key shares and verification vector off-chain. Encrypt each generated key share by public key of other nodes accordingly by ECDH method. Run function SkaleDKG.broadcast to send these data to the smart contract. During broadcast transaction secret key contribution and verification vector emits as an event to share the data with other participants and KeyStorage.adding to calculate BLS master public key. All private data(key shares) should be encrypted and it is safe to share encrypted data with other participants, only the owner of the public key can decrypt this data.

Alright by node - when node A received and verified all data from other nodes - Node A sends transaction to SkaleDKG contract to inform smart contact that node A calculated its own BLS private key.

Complaint by node - if node B does  not follow the rules node A can send a complaint on node B.

### 4.2. <a name='ComplaintTypes'></a>Complaint types

1. Node B missing broadcast in 30 minutes.
2. Node B missing alright in 30 minutes.
3. Node B missing response in 30 minutes.
4. Node B send bad data that node A could not verify it.

Response by node - when node A sends complaint of 4th type on node B. Node B should send a response to continue the dispute.
